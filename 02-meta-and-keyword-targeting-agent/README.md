# Week 2 - Meta & Keyword Targeting Agent

## Overview

This tool is designed to quickly generate SEO-optimized titles, meta descriptions and keyword targets for a target page and topic. It leverages AI and various APIs to provide both keyword targets and optimized content.

**Key Features:**

- Uses Google SERPER API to get the top search results for a given topic.
- Scrapes content from a target URL using Firecrawl API.
- Extracts and organizes keywords using DataForSEO API.
- Generates SEO-optimized title tags and meta descriptions.

## How It Works

This LangFlow flow is structured into two parallel flows that converge for final processing:

    A[User Input] --> B(Content Scraping);
    A --> C(Initial SERP Retrieval);
    B --> E(Data Combination);
    C --> D(Keyword Extraction);
    D --> E;
    E --> F(Keyword Targeting & Meta Generation);
    F --> G(Output Formatting);
    G --> H[Chat Output];

```

1.  **User Input:** The process begins with a user providing a target URL and a target topic via the **Chat Input** node.

2.  **Flow 1: Content Scraping:** This flow focuses on extracting and summarizing content from the target URL. It includes:

    - **Prompt (Main Content Scraper Prompt):** Formats a prompt to instruct the agent to scrape the content.
    - **Firecrawl Scrape API Tool:** Uses the Firecrawl API to scrape the content from the target URL.
    - **Agent (Main Content Scraper Agent):** Uses an LLM to scrape the content of the target URL and output it in markdown format.

3.  **Flow 2: Initial SERP and Keyword Analysis:** This flow focuses on identifying relevant search results and keywords. It includes:

    - **Agent (Get SERP Agent):** Uses an LLM to get the top 4 results for the target using the Google SERPER API.
    - **Google Serper API:** Uses the Google SERPER API to search for the given topic and retrieve the top 4 results.
    - **Prompt (Get SERP Prompt):** Formats a prompt to instruct the agent to use the Google SERPER API.
    - **Custom Component (PageKeywordsExtractorTool):** Uses the DataForSEO API to extract keywords for the target URL.
    - **Prompt (Keyword Extraction Prompt):** Formats a prompt to extract and organize keywords from URLs into a markdown table.
    - **Agent (Keyword Extraction Agent):** Uses an LLM to extract and organize keywords from URLs into a markdown table.

4.  **Data Combination:** This step combines the outputs from both flows into a single text chunk. It includes:

    - **Combine Text:** Combines the outputs from the agents and prompts into a single text chunk.

5.  **Keyword Targeting & Meta Generation:** This step focuses on creating SEO-optimized title tags and meta descriptions. It includes:

    - **Prompt (System Prompt):** Formats a prompt to create an SEO-optimized and compelling title tag and meta description for the article.
    - **OpenAI Model (for Title & Meta):** Uses an LLM to generate an SEO-optimized title tag and meta description for the article.

6.  **Output Formatting:** This step cleans up the final output. It includes:
    - **Custom Component (CleanMarkdown):** Uses the textwrap python module to clean the final markdown output.
    - **Chat Output:** Displays the final content outline and H1 heading in a user-friendly format.
