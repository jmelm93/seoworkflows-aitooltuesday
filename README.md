# SEO Workflows - AI Tool Tuesday Repository ðŸš€

Welcome to the SEO Workflows repository for AI Tool Tuesday! Every Tuesday, we're committed to bringing you a new AI-powered SEO tool to supercharge your workflows. This repository contains the configuration files you need to test these tools using LangFlow.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized by week, with each week's tool residing in its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- **`week_{num}-{flow_name}.json`**: The LangFlow configuration file for the specific tool.
- **`README.md`**: A detailed guide specific to that tool, including required environment variables and usage instructions.

## Getting Started:

### Setting Up LangFlow

To use these tools, you'll need a LangFlow instance. Here are a couple of options:

- **Datastax (Free Option):** Datastax offers a free way to host your LangFlow instance (as of 12/25/2025). Check it out here: [https://www.datastax.com/products/langflow](https://www.datastax.com/products/langflow)
- **Self-Deployment:** You can also deploy your own LangFlow instance. We recommend using Render.com, and you can find detailed instructions in the LangFlow documentation: [https://docs.langflow.org/deployment-render](https://docs.langflow.org/deployment-render)

### Testing the Tools with LangFlow
