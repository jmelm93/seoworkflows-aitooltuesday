# Week 1 - Internal Link Placement Agent

## Overview

This tool is designed to help with internal link placement strategy. It leverages AI to analyze web pages, generate summaries, and identify optimal linking opportunities within your content.

**Key Features:**

- Scrapes content from a target URL and a list of URLs to link.
- Provides concise summaries of the linked URLs.
- Suggests relevant anchor text and specific link placement locations within the target URL's content.

## How It Works

This LangFlow flow is structured with an initial split into two parallel flows that converge for final processing:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] --> B(Target Page Content Scraping);
    A --> C(Linking Targets Analysis);
    B --> D(Data Combination);
    C --> D;
    D --> E(Internal Link Targeting & Placement);
    E --> F[Chat Output];

    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

1.  **User Input:** The process begins with a user providing a target URL and a list of URLs to link via the **Chat Input** node.

2.  **Flow 1: Target Page Content Scraping:** This flow focuses on extracting the main content from the target URL. It includes:

    - **Prompt (Target URL Scrape):** Formats a prompt to instruct the agent to scrape the content of the target URL.
    - **Firecrawl Scrape API Tool:** Uses the Firecrawl API to scrape the content from the target URL.
    - **Agent (Main Content Scrape Agent):** Uses an LLM to scrape the content of the target URL and output it in markdown format.

3.  **Flow 2: Linking Targets Analysis:** This flow focuses on analyzing the URLs to link and generating summaries. It includes:

    - **Prompt (Linking Targets Summarization):** Formats a prompt to instruct the agent to summarize the content of the URLs to link.
    - **Firecrawl Scrape API Tool:** Uses the Firecrawl API to scrape the content from the URLs to link.
    - **Agent (Content Summarization Agent):** Uses an LLM to generate concise summaries of the content from the URLs to link.

4.  **Data Combination:** This step combines the outputs from both flows into a single text chunk. It includes:

    - **Combine Text:** Combines the summaries of the linked URLs and the scraped content of the target URL into a single text chunk.

5.  **Internal Link Targeting & Placement:** This step analyzes the combined text to determine the best internal link placements and anchor text. It includes:

    - **Agent (Internal Link Targeting Agent):** Uses an LLM to analyze the combined text and determine the best internal link placements and anchor text.
    - **Agent (Internal Link Placement Agent):** Uses an LLM to analyze content to provide updated text for link placement.

6.  **Output Display:** The final step displays the results in a user-friendly format. It includes:
    - **Chat Output:** Displays the results in a user-friendly markdown table format.
